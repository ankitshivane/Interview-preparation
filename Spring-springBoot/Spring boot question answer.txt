2. what are spring boot profiles?
Answer:
Spring Profiles provide a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it be available only in certain environments. Any @Component, @Configuration or @ConfigurationProperties can be marked with @Profile to limit when it is loaded, as shown in the following example:
Sample Code:
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@Profile("production")
public class ProductionConfiguration {
	// ...
}

Summary
Spring Boot Profiles are a powerful tool for managing environment-specific configurations.
They promote flexibility and maintainability by allowing an application to adapt to different environments seamlessly.
By following a few simple steps, developers can create and activate profiles to control an applicationâ€™s behavior in various contexts.

1. why Strings are immutable in Java?
answer - 
In Java, strings are immutable, which means once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed. This design choice has several advantages:

1. **Thread Safety:**
   - Immutability makes strings inherently thread-safe. Since the state of a string cannot be modified, it can be safely shared among multiple threads without the need for synchronization.

2. **Security:**
   - Strings are widely used in various contexts, including handling sensitive data like passwords. Immutability ensures that once a string is created, its value cannot be altered, reducing the risk of unintentional changes that could compromise security.

3. **Caching:**
   - String literals in Java are stored in a string pool, which allows for string interning. If two string literals with the same value are encountered, they refer to the same string object. This can lead to more efficient memory usage and better performance.

4. **Hashing:**
   - Immutable strings simplify hash code calculations. The hash code of a string can be computed once when the string is created and cached, improving the performance of hash-based data structures like `HashMap`.

5. **Simplicity and Predictability:**
   - Immutability simplifies the handling of strings by eliminating the need to manage changes and updates. This contributes to code predictability and makes reasoning about string operations more straightforward.

6. **Optimizations:**
   - Java can optimize string handling because of immutability. For example, the `substring()` method returns a new string that shares the same underlying character array, rather than creating a new array.

7. **String Pool:**
   - String literals are stored in a pool, and when a new string is created with the same value as an existing string literal, the existing instance is reused. This helps conserve memory.

However, it's worth noting that while the content of a `String` object is immutable, operations on strings can still result in new `String` objects being created. For performance-critical applications, using `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` may be more efficient when significant concatenation or modification operations are involved, as these classes allow for mutable string-like behavior.

3. what is marker interface in java?
Answer-
A marker interface in Java, also known as a "tag" interface, is an interface that does not declare any methods. Instead, it serves as a marker or tag to indicate to the compiler or runtime environment that a class implementing the interface should be treated in a certain way or has a specific characteristic. Marker interfaces are typically used for metadata or to categorize classes.

For example, the `java.io.Serializable` and `java.rmi.Remote` interfaces are marker interfaces. Classes that implement `Serializable` indicate that their instances can be serialized, and classes that implement `Remote` are meant to be used in remote method invocations.

Here's an example of a marker interface:

```java
public interface MyMarkerInterface {
}
```

You can create your own marker interface by defining an interface with no methods, just as shown in the example above. You can then have classes implement your marker interface to indicate their affiliation with a particular category or behavior.

However, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) does not have built-in knowledge of marker interfaces. It's up to the developer, the application, or third-party libraries and frameworks to interpret the meaning of marker interfaces and act accordingly.

For example, if you create a marker interface like `MyMarkerInterface`, you would need to rely on your code or any framework that you are using to recognize and respond to the fact that a class implements it. The JVM itself won't enforce or manage marker interfaces; it treats them like regular interfaces.

In summary, you can create your own marker interfaces in Java to categorize or tag classes, but it's your responsibility to define and implement the logic associated with those marker interfaces in your application code or through the use of specific libraries or frameworks.

---------------------- ----------------------

4. does marker interface contains Variable?
answer-
No, marker interfaces in Java do not typically have variables. Marker interfaces are essentially empty interfaces, which means they don't declare any methods or fields. Their primary purpose is to serve as markers or tags to provide metadata about classes that implement them.

5. what is the Internal working of Hashmap in java? or how hashmap internally works?
Answer-

Certainly! Here's a comprehensive answer to the common interview question, "What is the internal working of a HashMap?"

"A HashMap is a widely used data structure in Java that provides efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. Its internal working involves the use of an array of linked lists, which enables quick access to values based on their keys.

1. **Hashing Mechanism:** When you put a key-value pair into a HashMap, the key's `hashCode()` method is called to compute a hash code, which is an integer representation of the key. This hash code is used to determine the index at which the value will be stored in the underlying array.

2. **Array of Buckets:** The underlying data structure of a HashMap is an array of buckets. Each bucket is essentially a linked list or, in modern implementations, a tree (in the case of Java 8+ with high collision keys).

3. **Index Calculation:** The hash code is transformed into a valid index by using a modulo operation with the array's size. This index is where the value associated with the key will be stored.

4. **Collision Handling:** Due to the possibility of two different keys producing the same hash code (collision), HashMap uses linked lists (or trees) in each bucket to store multiple key-value pairs. If two keys have the same hash code, they will be placed in the same bucket.

5. **Get and Put Operations:** When you want to retrieve a value based on a key, the key's hash code is computed, and the appropriate bucket is located. The linked list (or tree) in that bucket is then traversed to find the key-value pair. For put operations, you follow the same process to store the key-value pair in the appropriate bucket.

6. **Load Factor:** A load factor is a measure of how full the HashMap is. When the load factor reaches a certain threshold (usually 0.75 in Java), the HashMap is resized, and the number of buckets is increased. This helps maintain efficient access times by reducing the likelihood of collisions.

7. **Key Equality:** To find the correct key-value pair within a bucket, HashMap uses the `equals()` method of keys to determine equality. If two keys have the same hash code but are not equal, they are considered distinct.

In summary, a HashMap uses the principles of hashing and indexing to provide fast access to values based on their keys. It handles collisions by storing multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket, and it dynamically resizes itself to maintain a balance between performance and memory usage. Understanding the internal workings of a HashMap is crucial for efficient data retrieval and manipulation in Java applications."




---------------------- ----------------------


6. What if two keys have same has code means there is hash collision so how user will get the value ? And which value he will get?
Answer-

In the case of a hash collision, where two keys produce the same hash code, the HashMap employs a mechanism to handle this situation and allow users to retrieve the correct value associated with their key. Here's how it works:

1. **Bucket with Collisions:** When two or more keys have the same hash code, they are placed in the same bucket. Each bucket in the HashMap contains a linked list (or a tree in more recent Java versions) to store key-value pairs.

2. **Key Equality:** To distinguish between keys with the same hash code, HashMap uses the `equals()` method of keys to determine equality. When you request a value based on a key, the HashMap searches the linked list (or tree) in the corresponding bucket to find the key that is equal to the key you provided.

3. **Value Retrieval:** The value associated with the key that matches the provided key (based on the `equals()` method) is retrieved and returned to the user.

In summary, if two keys produce the same hash code (hash collision), the HashMap stores them in the same bucket and uses the `equals()` method to determine the correct key-value pair. The user will get the value associated with the key that is equal to the key they used for the retrieval, ensuring they receive the appropriate value even in the presence of hash collisions.

-----------------------------------------

8.
how to use Object as a key in Hashmap
Answer:

**To use an object as a key in a HashMap:**

1. **Override equals() and hashCode():**
   - Ensure the class of the object overrides the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods.
   - The `equals()` method should provide a logical comparison of the object's content, and `hashCode()` should generate a consistent hash code based on those contents.

   ```java
   @Override
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
       // Custom logic for equality comparison
   }

   @Override
   public int hashCode() {
       // Custom logic for generating hash code
   }
   ```

2. **Immutability:**
   - Prefer using immutable objects as keys to maintain consistency. If a key is mutable and its state changes after being used as a key, it might lead to unexpected behavior in the HashMap.

3. **Consistent Hashing:**
   - Ensure that the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are implemented consistently. If two objects are equal, their hash codes must be equal as well.

4. **Handling Collisions:**
   - Understand that hash collisions can occur, and HashMap handles them using a linked list of entries or, in modern versions, a balanced tree for performance optimization.
   - A good hash function can help minimize collisions.

5. **Example Implementation:**
   - Provide an example of how you would implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` in the class.

   ```java
   @Override
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
       if (this == obj) return true;
       if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
       MyClass myObject = (MyClass) obj;
       return Objects.equals(property1, myObject.property1) &&
              Objects.equals(property2, myObject.property2);
   }

   @Override
   public int hashCode() {
       return Objects.hash(property1, property2);
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that the object can be used effectively as a key in a HashMap, maintaining the integrity of the key-value associations and optimizing retrieval performance.

9. Explain has-a relationship in details and how it is different from is-a relationship and write code for this
Answer--
Certainly! In object-oriented programming, the "has-a" relationship is a form of association where one class has a member that is an object of another class. It is also known as composition or aggregation. Unlike the "is-a" relationship, which is based on inheritance, the "has-a" relationship is based on encapsulation and the use of objects as attributes.

### "has-a" Relationship:

- **Definition:** A class has a "has-a" relationship with another class if it contains an instance of that class as a member.

- **Example:** Consider a `Car` class that has a "has-a" relationship with an `Engine` class. Each car "has an" engine.

```java
class Engine {
    // Engine class code
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Car has an Engine

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    // Other Car class code
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class contains an instance variable `engine` of type `Engine`. This represents a "has-a" relationship between `Car` and `Engine`.

### "has-a" vs "is-a" Relationship:

- **"is-a" Relationship:** This is established through inheritance. For example, if `B` extends `A`, it means "B is a type of A."

  ```java
  class A {
      // A class code
  }

  class B extends A {
      // B is a type of A
  }
  ```

- **"has-a" Relationship:** This is established through composition or aggregation. It signifies that one class has another class as a part or member.

  ```java
  class Engine {
      // Engine class code
  }

  class Car {
      private Engine engine; // Car has an Engine

      // Other Car class code
  }
  ```

### Code Example:

```java
class Engine {
    private String type;

    public Engine(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public String getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Car has an Engine

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car with " + engine.getType() + " engine is starting.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine myEngine = new Engine("V8");
        Car myCar = new Car(myEngine);

        myCar.start(); // Output: Car with V8 engine is starting.
    }
}
```

In this example, `Car` has a "has-a" relationship with `Engine`. The `Car` class contains an instance of the `Engine` class as a member, and it can utilize the functionality of the `Engine` class through this composition.



---------------------------------------------

What is the difference between composition and aggression or they are same ?

answers-

In object-oriented programming, composition and aggregation are both forms of association that describe relationships between classes, but they differ in the strength and ownership of the relationship.

### Composition:

- **Definition:** Composition is a strong form of association where one class (the whole) is composed of another class (the part). The part has no independent existence; it exists only within the context of the whole. If the whole is destroyed, its parts are also destroyed.

- **Ownership:** In composition, the parent class owns the objects of the child class.

- **Example:** If a `Car` class has an `Engine` class as a member, and the `Engine` is an integral part of the `Car`, this is an example of composition.

```java
class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Composition
}
```

### Aggregation:

- **Definition:** Aggregation is a weaker form of association where one class (the whole) has another class (the part) as a member, but the part can exist independently of the whole. If the whole is destroyed, its parts can still exist.

- **Ownership:** In aggregation, the parent class does not necessarily own the objects of the child class; they can exist independently.

- **Example:** If a `University` class has a collection of `Student` objects, and a `Student` can exist outside the context of the `University`, this is an example of aggregation.

```java
class University {
    private List<Student> students; // Aggregation
}
```

### Key Differences:

1. **Ownership and Lifespan:**
   - **Composition:** The whole (parent) owns the parts (children), and the lifespan of the parts is dependent on the lifespan of the whole.
   - **Aggregation:** The whole (parent) may reference parts (children), but the parts can exist independently of the whole.

2. **Dependency:**
   - **Composition:** Strong dependency. The child object is a crucial part of the parent object.
   - **Aggregation:** Weaker dependency. The child object can exist independently and may be used by multiple parent objects.

3. **Terminology:**
   - **Composition:** Sometimes referred to as a "has-a" relationship.
   - **Aggregation:** Sometimes referred to as a "has-a" relationship as well, but with a weaker association.

### Code Example:

Here's a brief example to illustrate the difference:

```java
// Composition
class Engine {
    // Engine class code
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Car has an Engine (composition)
}

// Aggregation
class Student {
    // Student class code
}

class University {
    private List<Student> students; // University has Students (aggregation)
}
```

In summary, composition and aggregation both describe relationships between classes, but composition implies a stronger, more exclusive relationship where the part is an integral component of the whole, while aggregation suggests a looser relationship where the part can exist independently.

question
As we know singleton class create only one object but what if we make a class as  cloneable and make clones then it will broke the rule of singleton class
Answer -

implementing the Cloneable interface in a singleton class could potentially violate the singleton pattern by allowing multiple instances to be created through cloning. However, there are ways to prevent this from happening.

to maintain the singleton pattern while implementing the Cloneable interface:

Override the clone Method:
1.
Override the clone method inherited from the Object class and throw a CloneNotSupportedException to prevent cloning. This way, attempting to clone the singleton object will result in an exception.
2.
Handle Cloning Logic:

If allowing cloning is necessary for your application but you still want to maintain the singleton pattern, you can handle the cloning logic within the clone method itself. For example, you could throw an exception if cloning is attempted after the singleton instance has been created.
Here's an example demonstrating how to prevent cloning in a singleton class:

public class Singleton implements Cloneable {
    private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Cloning of singleton objects is not allowed");
    }
}

There is an interview question Why do we need functional interface in Java
Answer
in Java 8. Here's why we need functional interfaces in Java:

Lambda Expressions:
1.
Functional interfaces provide a single abstract method (SAM) that can be implemented using lambda expressions. This allows for concise and expressive code when working with functional programming constructs.
2.
Stream API:
Functional interfaces play a crucial role in the Stream API introduced in Java 8. Many methods in the Stream API, such as map, filter, and reduce, accept functional interfaces as parameters. This allows for fluent and declarative stream processing operations.
3.
API Design:
Functional interfaces promote better API design by encouraging developers to design methods that accept functional interfaces as parameters. This leads to more flexible and composable APIs that can accommodate a wide range of behaviors and use cases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLID design principles 

https://www.adaface.com/blog/solid-principles-interview-questions/

-------------------------------------------
why should we use optional keyword in java when we have null check doing same task?
answer -

The `Optional` class in Java provides a safer and more expressive alternative to null checks:

1. **Clarity**: Clearly indicates potential absence of a value.
2. **Safety**: Helps prevent NullPointerExceptions.
3. **Explicit Handling**: Encourages explicit handling of both present and absent values.
4. **Functional Programming**: Supports functional programming principles.
5. **Stream API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Stream API.
6. **API Consistency**: Establishes a consistent approach for handling optional values.

In essence, `Optional` promotes clarity, safety, and consistency in code while facilitating functional programming and integration with Java's Stream API.

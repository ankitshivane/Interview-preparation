Java 8 coding questions:
1. from a given string find all cosecutive character
Answer by my: wrong output it gave duplicate element not consecutive

		List<Character> charList = str.chars().mapToObj(c -> (char) c).collect(Collectors.toList());
		Map<Character, List<Character>> consecutiveChar = charList.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy((c) -> c));

		consecutiveChar.forEach((k, v) -> {
			System.out.println("Consecutive char:" + k);
			System.out.println("List Size:" + v.size());
			System.out.println("Values:" + v);
		});

2. from the same string object find a unique character or non repeating character
Answer: Correct 

		Map<Character, Long> collect = str.chars().mapToObj(c -> (char) c)
				.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));

		collect.entrySet().stream().filter(e -> e.getValue() == 1).map(entry -> entry.getKey().toString())
				.forEach(System.out::print);

3. assume the
answer
List<Branch> ls;
		List<String> topPerfBranches=ls.stream().sorted(Branch.comparingInt(Branch::getSales))
		.reversed().limit(5).map(Branch::getBranches).collect(Collectors.toList());

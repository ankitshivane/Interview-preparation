Coding Questions all using java 8 streams:

2. lets say we have two arrays so I want to merge those arrays into one and get a sorted array from them
3. from a given string get a count of each character in string 

SQL:
1. write a SQL Query to get 2nd highest salary of the employee?
//		select * from Employee where salary<(select max(salary) from Employee;) limit 1;

2. write a SQL query to get max salary department wise

Answer:

package com.example.demo;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;


public class TestCls {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
// Answer for question 1
		List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("mango", "apple", "banana");
		Optional<String> max = fruits.stream().max((s1, s2) -> Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length()));

//		max.ifPresent(i -> System.out.println("Longest str:" + i));

// Answer for question 2
		int[] arr1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
		int[] arr2 = { 6, 7 };
		int[] result = IntStream.concat(Arrays.stream(arr1), Arrays.stream(arr2)).sorted().toArray();
//		for (int num : result) {
//			System.out.println(num);
//		}

// Answer for question 3
		String str = "aaaccbbb";
		Map<Character, Long> group = str.chars().mapToObj(c->(char)c).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(i->i, Collectors.counting()));
		group.entrySet().stream().forEach(i->{
			System.out.println("Char:"+i.getKey()+", Value:"+i.getValue());
		});
